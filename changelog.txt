= Version 1.23 / 1.20, 25.08.2024
   * Updated MbedTLS to v3.6.0.
   * Used SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM v8.12a.

= Version 1.22 / 1.20, 11.12.2023
   * Updated MbedTLS to v3.5.1.
   * TLS 1.3 support enabled.

   * Obsoleted CBC ciphers removed.
   * HSTS header added.

= Version 1.20 / 1.20, 03.12.2023
   * Used SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM v7.32a.
   * Updated MbedTLS to v2.28.5.
   * Changed to chained certificates support only.
   * Added support to update the certificates.
   * Some further changes adopted by my internal reference.

= 26.09.2023
   * New lwIP version STABLE-2_2_0_RELEASE used.

= 18.09.2023
   * Updated MbedTLS to v2.28.4
   * Used SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM v7.32.

= 22.04.2023
   * Updated MbedTLS to v2.28.3
   * Used SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM v7.12a.

= 11.03.2023
   * Changed changelog format.
   * Used SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM v7.12.
   * Removed uC/OS-III support.
   * Updated tal and tcts headers.
   * Updated tcts functionality.
   * Added and used old FatFs function mem_set, mem_cmp and chk_chr.

= 28.12.2022
   * Reworked TOTP functionality.
     Added own check function, WebUserCheckUserPasswordTOTP.
     Added functionality to disable two-factor authentication using TOTP.

= 27.12.2022
   * Added support for two-factor authentication using TOTP.
   * Added support for password reset. In case a password should be reseted,
     a password reset request code will be generated by the TinyONE server.
     The format of the request code looks like: 1122-3344-5566-7788
     The reset code is now generated with this request code and your secret
     algorithm. The current "secret" algorithm uses the reset request code in
     reverse order. That mean that for the request code 1122-3344-5566-7788
     the reset code looks like 8877665544332211. You must implement your own
     secret algorithm in function CreateResetCodeByRequest (web_user.c).

= 21.12.2022

     a TinyELCA server if needed.

   * Added interrupt protection in memory management.
   * Change statistic task priority from 2 to 254.
