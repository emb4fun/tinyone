A BeagleBone Black with additional cape is used as hardware here. 
The BeagleBone Black is configured to start from a connected SPI-Flash. 
The SPI-Flash and an additional DUO-Led are located on the corresponding
cape. The actual program is stored on the SD card and is loaded and started
by the bootloader in the SPI flash.
